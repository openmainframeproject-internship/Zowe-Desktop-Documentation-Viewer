# Zowe Desktop Documentation Viewer

A default web application that enables users to view text & pdf documents bundled into plugins. This viewer can be invoked via the Desktop’s App2App communication scheme so that it can be popped up on-demand by the plugin, or opened directly by the user for them to be able to drill-down to each plugin & each documentation file.
